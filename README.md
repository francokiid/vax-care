## Project Scope

Vax-Care is a web-based system designed to streamline the management of data regarding the immunization of pregnant women and newborns in Barangay Haligue Silangan, Batangas City. It aims to replace the existing manual recordkeeping procedures, increase productivity and efficiency in the community’s health facility, and reduce the risks of sluggish data processing, data duplication/loss, and inaccurate reporting. 

The system has two primary beneficiaries: Barangay Health Workers (BHWs), whose workload will be significantly reduced; as well as pregnant women and newborns, who will receive the quality vaccination service they deserve.


## Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being

Vax-Care’s desired impact aligns with SDG 3, specifically Targets 3.1 and 3.2, which recognize the significance of safeguarding the well-being of all individuals by reducing the global maternal mortality ratio and preventing deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age. With improved services in community health facilities, vaccination rates can be maximized and missed doses can be minimized, significantly reducing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. 

## Objectives of the Project

The main objective of the project is to design and develop a centralized and fully functional web-based records management system for the routine immunization of pregnant women and newborns. </br></br>Specifically, it aims to achieve the following objectives: </br>

<ol>
  <li> 
    To develop a barangay health worker (BHW) module that enables authorized BHWs to coherently manage interrelated immunization records, particularly the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Vaccine recipients</li>
    <li>Vaccine inventory</li>
    <li>Vaccination schedules</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>To develop a vaccine recipient module that enables authorized recipients to access the following features:
  <ol>
    <li>Submission of a vaccine recipient module</li>
    <li>Cancellation of schedules and request for reschedules</li>
    <li>Retrieval of a personalized digital immunization booklet</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    To generate the following information:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Real-time statistical cards and charts of immunization data, particularly the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Immunization coverage and dropout rates</li>
          <li>Vaccine on hand, reserved and available</li>
          <li>Recipient demographics</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Accurate monthly immunization reports deemed necessary by the City Health Office</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
